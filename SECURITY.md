# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover any security-related issue, please **do not open a public GitHub issue**.  
Instead, email the details (with proof-of-concept if possible) to:

    7errors+singpass-myinfo@gmail.com

You should receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours and a more detailed response within 5 days.

## Disclosure Policy
- We will investigate and confirm the report.  
- After confirmation we’ll release a fix and credit you (unless you request anonymity).  
- Public disclosure happens only after a new stable release containing the fix.

Thank you for helping keep the community safe!
